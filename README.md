Graph
=====

A proof of concept Python implementation of Prismatic's
[Graph](https://github.com/Prismatic/plumbing) Clojure library.

Why?  Because Graph allows one to express complex computations more cleanly and declaratively.  

Linguistic Technology
---------------------

Prismatic's implementation relies on their keyword function macro (`fnk`).  
This macro solution is not available in the Python language. 
Instead this library relies on Python function introspection.
